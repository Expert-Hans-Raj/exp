Dear Sir,

I just wanted to take a minute to apologize for that and I want to offer an explanation. This is not an excuse;
 I just feel you should know why my work has suffered.
The project which I am working on currently requires custom mega menu, custom filters and other
 functionality which was taking more time than I thought because every theme has its own code structure.
Going forward I promise that I will put best efforts to prove my work to you and assure 
you that you will not get any more complaints from my side. Hope you will accept my apologies and give me another chance to prove myself.

Thanks & Regards
